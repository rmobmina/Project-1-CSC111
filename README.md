This project is a small-scale adventure game that takes place at the University of Toronto. The plot is as follows.

"You've got an important exam coming up this evening, and you've been studying for weeks.
Last night was a particularly late night on campus.
You had difficulty focusing, so rather than staying in one place, you studied in various places throughout campus as the night progressed.
Unfortunately, when you woke up this morning, you were missing some important exam-related items.
You cannot find your T-card, and you're nervous they won't let you into tonight's exam without it.
Also, you seem to have misplaced your lucky exam pen -- even if they let you in, you can't possibly write with another pen!
Finally, your instructor for the course lets you bring a cheat sheet - a handwritten page of information in the exam.
Last night, you painstakingly crammed as much material onto a single page as humanly possible, but that's missing, too!
All of this stuff must be around campus somewhere! Can you find all of it before your exam starts tonight?"

This adventure game will allow players to try to find all of the required items prior to the exam starting. 
If the player finds all of the items and brings them to the exam room before the exam starts, they "win" the game.
