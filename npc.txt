Sadia: It's nice to see you again, {name}! Thank you for attending the final 111 lecture. It got pretty wild yesterday.
Everyone started dumping everything out of their bags, throwing pens and papers into the air. At the end, it
became a huge mess. I wish I could help the cleaning staff... Maybe if you have time you can help clean up? Just go to
the Convocation Hall and dial in so someone can open the doors for you. The number is the area under the curve of y = x
from x = 0 to x = 56. See ya later, {name}!

Reena: Hey {name}! Are you okay? You look awfully tired today. Perhaps it has to do with that show you put on last night
at the subway? {name}, you are quite the feisty! Oh... Did you forget what happened? You fought a man on the train. But
he ended up grabbing your things and placing it in his little stash. It's sealed with an old rusty lock. And lucky for
you, he forgot to mix up the numbers. The code is the sum of 89 and 222, multiplied by 4.

Akram: Hold on! {name}, why do you look like you're in such a rush? Oh yeah... Today is the test for 157. Before I
forget, you forgot your Cheat Sheet at Goldring! I meant to hand it to you after I finished my set, but you were already
far gone. {name}, you really are one of a kind, I've never seen anyone study while running on the treadmill before.
Don't stress, it's just in my locker. The code is the limit of the funcion f(x)= (3124x)/x as x approaches 1. Hehe.
Let's put your studying to some good use!
