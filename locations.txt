Hmmm... I don't know if there's anything to see here, looks like a dead end.

You probably shouldn't go here.

You are currently in your dorm room. In just a few hours you will have to write the hardest exam of your life
(MAT157)! But... There's a problem. You misplaced all your things! There's no way you can write the test without your
T-card, Lucky pen, and cheat sheet. There's not much time left, you better get going and find your things!

Nothing here... just your bed and an endless pile of notes and practice exams. Make sure to return all your things here
before you head to the exam centre!

You are at every UofT(ears) student's favourite place in the world, Robarts! You were studying here last night but
decided to leave because you could hear sniffles at every direction. After all, it is finals season.

Books. Tears. And even more tears. Welcome to Robarts!

You are at St. George Station right now. Why were you here last night? No clue. All you remember is the screeching
noises of the subway and the homeless man that tried to snoop into your backpack. Everything else is just a blur.

St. George Station. The TTC. What more can I say?

Yesterday you decided to go to Queen's Park to get some fresh air. But... all you could smell is Toronto pollution, so
you had to leave before you get another asthma attack! But hey, you touched some grass! 10/10 for effort!

Queen's Park, land of the hippies and tree huggers.

Bahen is famous for many things. Brilliant architecture? Well, perhaps. It's actually the CS students. They enter in
groups and release their distinct scent for the whole world to smell. This aroma smells nothing like fresh flowers or
vanilla. It just reeks of sweat and rotten eggs, which explains why you had to leave ASAP!

RUN! The CS students are at Bahen! Spray them with some deodorant first!

The Myhal Centre is where you met up with some friends after class yesterday. They were also on that finals week grind,
so you didn't stay for long! Oh well, at least you got to socialize for once!

Myhal. It's just Bahen 2.0.

After a long day of studying all you needed was some cheap yet quality food. May I present to you the Brown Food Truck!
What are you feeling today? Poutine, hot dogs, or some pop? Ooo! You can always order them all.

Are you craving the Brown Food Truck today?

Gosh there's so much construction at King's College Circle! I don't think you can even see what's on the other side!
Hopefully the project is going to be completed soon. You want to see where your expensive tuition goes towards! There
are really no shortcuts here.

Ouch! My ears hurt with all the construction at King's College Circle!

You get the chills whenever you enter the Exam Centre. In fact, even just the thought of it makes your soul leave your
body. Later, you will be back here to write your exam! Ah! You're sweating already!

Welcome to Hell! Uh. I mean the Exam Centre!

When you were out last night you passed the Sketchy Alley. You swore you heard some creepy noises. I don't think it's
very safe here. You could get jumped any moment from now.

We should probably leave this Sketchy Alley.

You took a break and decided to go to the Convocation Hall, it's large and very pretty. It's going to be a while until
you walk across that stage, collect your degree, and enter the real world. Oh what a dream that would be... First you
have to pass this final before you can even think about things like that!

You are at the Convocation Hall right now. What are you gonna do? Graduate? Aha!
